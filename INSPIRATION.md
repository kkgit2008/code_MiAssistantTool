# INSPIRATION

**MiAssistantTool** is my first project in the C programming language.

The idea for this project was inspired by the code found at the following link:
[main.c](https://github.com/GautamGreat/xiaomi_adb_sideload/blob/1d3859f698726f5b4551598703c828ffefbb95c9/main.c) from the repo:
[xiaomi_adb_sideload](https://github.com/GautamGreat/xiaomi_adb_sideload.git),
which does not include any license.

Although I was inspired by this project, I rebuilt **MiAssistantTool** from scratch with my own improvements and modifications. This project has been an opportunity for me to develop my skills in C programming and gain a deeper understanding of building tools for managing Xiaomi devices.
